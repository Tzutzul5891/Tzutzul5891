# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a focus on Rust and C, working on various projects related to systems programming and terminal applications.

## 🚀 Projects I'm Working On

### 🔐 SSH Implementation in Rust
- Asynchronous SSH implementation using **OpenSSL** for RSA and **AES** for encryption.
- Handles secure communication between clients and servers.
- Designed to follow OpenSSH standards.

### 🖥️ SSH Server in C
- A multi-client SSH server built in C using **libsodium** for encryption.
- Assigns each client its own working directory.

### 📂 Total Commander-like Terminal App in Rust
- A file manager built with **Ratatu**i.
- Features split directory view, renaming, cutting, copying, and searching.
- Uses **Devicons** for file type indicators.

### 🔍 Fast File Search in Rust
- No external search libraries used.
- Optimized for speed with `tokio`.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Rust, C, C++
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Ratatui, OpenSSL, libsodium
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Make, Cargo
- **Concepts:** Asynchronous programming, parallel computing, encryption
