Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate developer with a focus on Rust and C, working on various projects related to systems programming and terminal applications.

🚀 Projects I'm Working On

🖥️ SSH Server in C

A multi-client SSH server built in C using libsodium for encryption.

Supports shell commands like cd and pwd.

Assigns each client its own working directory.
